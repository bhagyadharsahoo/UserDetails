# UserDetails
UserDetailsTask is a native iOS application built using SwiftUI and MVVM architecture that demonstrates clean architecture principles, modern concurrency, and scalable UI design. The app fetches user data from a public REST API and presents it in a modular, interactive, and performant user interface.

The primary goal of this project is to showcase real-world iOS development practices, including API integration using async/await, separation of concerns with MVVM, SOLID-compliant design, state-driven UI in SwiftUI, and modular code organization
