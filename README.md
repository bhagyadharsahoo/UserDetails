UserDetailsTask is a native iOS application built with SwiftUI and MVVM architecture. The app consumes a public REST API to display user data in a modular, interactive interface with support for searching, filtering, pull-to-refresh, and detailed user views. The project emphasizes clean architecture, SOLID principles, async/await networking, and state-driven UI design.
